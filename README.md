Github repository of a small website containing several lists/collections of links to resources related to research and teaching and career. [See the website here](https://andreashandel.github.io/research-and-teaching-resources/).

*Almost all content has been moved to to my [Modern Applied Data Analysis (MADA) course website](https://andreashandel.github.io/MADAcourse/). A lot was outdated too. I therefore basically shut down this website, it only exists so you are not having a 404 error when coming here 😁.*
