This list is a collection of specific commands to do specific, often-needed (at least by me) data cleaning and prepping tasks in R. Most of the commands use the ['tidyverse' packages](https://github.com/hadley/tidyverse). So to make sure commands work, you need the corresponding packages, most simply done by `install.packages(tidyverse)` to get them _all_.

Also check out the data wrangling related cheat-sheets [here at R Studio's website](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/).


__Conventions:__ The data is assumed to be a data frame called `dat`, I'm using the pipe-operator notation, the outcome of interest is called `outcome`, variables are `var1`, `var2`, etc. or just refered to as `varname`


### Renaming a column/variable
`newdat <- dat %>% rename(newvarname = oldvarname)`  


### Renaming values of a a variable
In this example, the value infctd in varname is replaced by 'infected'

`newdat <- dat %>% mutate(varname = replace(varname, varname=='infctd','infected')`  


### Resorting variables
While usually it doesn't matter at which position which variable is, sometimes it's more convenient to for instance have the outcome at the beginning. This can be done as follows:

`newdat <- dat %>% select(outcome, everything() )`

More general sorting/arranging can be done like this (if you don't have too many variables):

`newdat <- dat %>% select(var1, var2, var3, var4, ... )`


### Remove variables
Either just pick the ones you want to keep

`newdat <- dat %>% select ( c(var1,var2,var3))`

Or delete the ones you don't want to keep

`newdat <- dat %>% select ( -c(var4,var5,var6) )`

### Add a variabe

`newdat <- dat %>% mutate( newvar = var3*var4)`

### Filter rows based on values of a specific variable

`newdat <- dat %>% filter( var == 3)`

`newdat <- dat %>% filter( !is.na(var) )`


### Checking for NA

Lists numbers of NA for each column/variable
`print(colSums(is.na(dat)))` 

Nice graphical way using the Amelia package

`library(Amelia); missmap(dat)`

### Replace all values in a data frame with a different value
