This small website used to contain a collection of lists with links to various resources that are related to my ([Andreas Handel](https://www.andreashandel.com/)) research and teaching.

Almost all content has been moved to to my [Modern Applied Data Analysis (MADA) course website](https://andreashandel.github.io/MADAcourse/). A lot was outdated too. I therefore decided to shut down this website, this page only exists so you are not having a 404 error when coming here üòÅ.

Please visit the MADA course website for anything related to data analysis (see the 'Resources' section of the page) and my personal website for other possibly useful content.

If there was something here that you can't find and really want to see again, let me know.
